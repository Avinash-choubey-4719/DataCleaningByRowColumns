# DataCleaningByRowColumns

Data Cleaning is nothing but the process of cleaning the data.
It means, initially whatever data we will get say x, this dataset x will contains some impuritites in it. So, for better performance of the model
we have to remove those impurities from that particular data. This process of removing the impurities is nothing but the data Cleaning.

Here, in this project I'm just given the process of data Cleaning by deleting the rows and columns only.

But, data apart from deleting the rows and columns , one can also able to clean the data.

Data Cleaning through rows and columns is one of the most popular method of data Cleaning.

I have given the dataset as well as code to understand how the data cleaning is done.............
